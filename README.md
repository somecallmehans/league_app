# Commander League Web App

## Background

Commander League is a unique play environment for Magic: The Gathering's Commander format.

Each month, players build new decks and compete to earn points based on a league-defined scoring system that rewards creative, strategic, and thematic play. The player with the highest point total at the end of the month is crowned the league champion.

This application was developed so that:

1. Volunteers have a singular place to track scores, generate competitive pairings, and generally maintain point structures

2. Participants have a reference place for their performance during league in the form of leaderboards and other metrics

## About This Application

This mono repo contains both the frontend (tabernacle) and backend (tome) for the league app. 

Tabernacle was built using React and Redux Tool Kit. Once my list of desired features is complete I'd like to migrate this whole side of the repo to Typescript.

Tome is built using Django + Django Rest Framework connected to a Postgresql DB hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).
